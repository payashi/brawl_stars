# Crawl Stars
## Why I made the program
This product has been made to play an interesting game with a friend of mine.<br>
The game is really similar to *Brawl Stars* by [*Supercell*](https://supercell.com/en/) because the friend is **seriously** addicted to this game.
But the difference from the original is that the players of this game are not us, but NPCs operated by our codings.<br>
I hope this game will be an amusing one for us.<br>
## Collaborators
payashi:  it's me. I'm a beginner programmer, learning python, competitive programming and so on.<br>

matope:   one of top Japanese players of *Clash of Clans*, and also a good player of *Brawl Stars*.<br><br>

I will face a joint team of the two
